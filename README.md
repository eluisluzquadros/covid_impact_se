## Challenge
This is a repository about Covid-19 impacts on Software Engineering based on Multivocal Literature Review (MLR).

## Solution
White literature is a academic peer review paper.
Grey literature review is a data font very important today.
But, there are diverse kinds of fonts (blogs, white paper, webinars ...) and data formats (text, video, audio). Then, how to collect, analyze, and reveal the grey literature value in the age of knowledge or age of big data?

For this challenge, we proposed an analytics mindset and an analytics pipeline that combines Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Dataviz to data analyze and to reveal Covid-19 impacts in Software Engineering through gray literature.

### Steps
1. 
    1. collect grey with scraper
    2. merge   grey datasets 
    3. collect white	manual
2.
    1. categorization grey	manual
    2. categorization white	manual
3.
    1. pnl grey
    2. pnl white
    3. pnl multivocal
4. eda multivocal categories & dimensions

## Benefits
Save of time, resources, computational enforcement, automation are some benefits of this methodology. This methodology is generalized, then you can test in other areas of the domain and create your own cases of studies.
